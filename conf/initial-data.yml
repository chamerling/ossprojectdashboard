     description: PEtALS is the highly distributed Open Source ESB hosted by OW2. PEtALS delivers OW2 JavaTM Business Integration (JBI) platform. PEtALS provides lightweight and packaged integration solutions, based on JSR-208 specifications, with a strong focus on distribution and clustering. PEtALS helps you to integrate your Enterprise Business Units in order to provide a value added global solution. By assembling all your enterprise elements, you can provide new applications by re-using some existing ones. Thus, all your applications expose their logic by exposing services. This concept is know as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The project also provides a set of JBI components and a component development kit that will help users to develop their own components.
